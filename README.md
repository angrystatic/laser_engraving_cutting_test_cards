If this looks oversized in your browser, its because the file has some unique features:

<ul>
  <li>It doesn't have any featuers for testing cutting</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The idea is to make a different file later for cutting, so far. For now its engraving only.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The file is the shape and size of an envelope as a reference measurement</li>
  <li>Serif font Times New Roman 5pt to 12 pt size</li>
  <li>Sans Serif font Arial 5pt to 12 pt size</li>
  <li>Seimans Star for off axis etching to an infinitly small point. This checks for off axis issues</li>
  <li>Shaded graduations</li>
  <li>USAF-1951 3 Bar chart. Bars are 2mm high by 10 mm long.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Look for the smallest set of bars you can differentiate.</li>
    <li>write down the group number and element number and use that in the formula shown on the card.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Now you know the minimum resolvable line pairs for that power & speed combination.</li>
      </ul>
     </ul>
</ul>
